MAIN calls the other functions and should be used to run the model. It contains the torque balance and visualisation components. 
parameters can be used to define constants and other model parameters. 
flexure computes the vertical elastic plate displacement. 
f_plate_2D contains the evaluation of stress and strain within the plate, as well as Anderson yield strenght. It produces the reduction in effective plate thickness. 
videos saves the dynamic plots. 

Further functions are helpers for various plotting purposes. Respective authors should be referenced within.
