- MAIN calls the other functions and should be used to run the model. It contains the torque balance and visualisation components. <br />
- parameters can be used to define constants, other parameters, and model settings. <br />
- flexure computes the vertical elastic plate displacement. <br />
- f_plate_2D contains the evaluation of stress and strain within the plate, as well as Anderson yield strenght. It produces the reduction in effective plate thickness. <br />
- videos saves the dynamic plots. 

Further functions are helpers for various plotting purposes. Respective authors should be referenced within.
